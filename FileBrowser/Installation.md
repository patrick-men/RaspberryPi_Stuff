Initially, Docker needed to be installed. The Raspbian OS was a fresh install in an attempt to clear the NCP leftovers, since it rooted itself deep into the system:
```bash
curl -fsSL https://get.Docker.com -o get-Docker.sh
```

Afterwards, the required image needed to be pulled, but not run yet. To run the file, a [docker-compose.yml](docker-compose.yml) file was used.
