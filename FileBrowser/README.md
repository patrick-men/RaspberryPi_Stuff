# Filebrowser

After a mildly unsuccessfull use of NextCloudPi, I've decided to use another cloud-like service. Filebrowser came up, as well as the possibility to deploy it using Docker. This is supposed to be a more lightweight, and less instrusive alternative to NCP.

In the beginning, the performance of the Pi whilst running Docker needs to be observed - technically that shouldn't be an issue on a lightweight application such as FileBrowser.

# Users
So far, i haven't managed to make useres persistent. As such, all users need to be recreated when the container restarts.


# docker-compose location
