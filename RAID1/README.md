# RAID1
The goal is to create a RAID1 on the raspi, so that the files saved on the present NextCloud instance can be backed up.
For this project, two 1tb HDDs are used, which will be connected through an external hub with its own power cord.

After the RAID1 is set up, the nextcloud will be moved over to the drive(s), leaving the 64GB SD Card for system relevant operations, thus not "wasting" space.
